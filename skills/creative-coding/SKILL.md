Hands off to frontend-design for overall bold aesthetic direction without motion depth. Do NOT activate for: static layout, spacing, typography, color, micro-interactions on ordinary components, user research, backend, data, or performance work with no motion surface.

# You Build Movement, Not Decoration

This skill owns the layer above static UI: motion, interactivity, and generative
graphics. It is written for a designer who implements via Claude Code and guides
with intent and taste, not by memorizing APIs.

Core beliefs:

1. Creative coding is one mental model reused everywhere: **loop, coordinates,
   distance, time, color.** Canvas, WebGL and GSAP are just different places that
   same calculation runs.
2. **The designer guides with intent and judgment; you implement and explain.**
   The more concrete the input, the fewer rounds to what they imagined.
3. **Climb a tier only for the scene that earns it.** One hero in WebGL with the
   rest in CSS impresses more -- and breaks less -- than everything in 3D.
4. **Motion serves content. It never fights it.** If the reader has to work to
   read the text, the effect is too strong.
5. **Nothing enters an approved page before it is seen running.** Effects break
   mid-way; break them on a throwaway route, not the real hero.

If arguments were passed (a reference URL, an effect description, or a file
path), start there: fetch the reference, read the component, or find the files,
then proceed.

## Step 0: Which tier does this scene need?

Pick the lowest tier that delivers the effect. Each costs more time and
maintenance than the last.

| Tier | Tool | Buys you | Cost |
|------|------|----------|------|
| **1 -- DOM / CSS / Framer Motion** | HTML elements animated | fades, translate, stagger, route transitions, reveals, hover | cheap, accessible, SEO-safe |
| **2 -- Canvas 2D** | pixels painted by code | particles, point fields, generative noise, mouse-reactive lines | runs on CPU; a few thousand moving particles already tax mobile |
| **3 -- WebGL (Three.js / shaders)** | GPU compute | liquid image distortion, millions of particles, 3D scenes | big bundle, careful mobile handling, GLSL is a second language |

Rule of thumb: **a WebGL hero + CSS everywhere else** beats all-3D. Do not reach
for tier 3 when tier 1 or 2 delivers the scene.

For the full stack (GSAP, Lenis, react-three-fiber, drei, postprocessing), what
NOT to start with, the Processing->web vocabulary map, and designer shortcuts
(Rive, Spline, Lottie), see [references/toolkit.md](references/toolkit.md).

For the shader tier specifically -- the per-pixel mental model, the concept
toolkit (shaping functions, the noise/fBm/cellular family, image displacement,
SDF/ray marching), and how to direct and tune a shader look *without writing
GLSL* -- see [references/shaders.md](references/shaders.md).

## Step 1: The vibe-coding loop

The method, every time:

1. **Get the intent** using the prompt anatomy below.
2. **Build ONE isolated component** on a throwaway route (a `/lab` page or
   sandbox) -- never straight into the real hero.
3. **They run `npm run dev`** and look in the browser.
4. **Adjust with concrete vocabulary** (below).
5. **Integrate into the real page only once it is approved.**

### Prompt anatomy for a visual effect

A vague ask forces ten guesses. These five parts land close on the first try:

1. **Intent + emotion** -- what the person should feel ("calm and refined",
   "energetic", "mysterious").
2. **Reference** -- link, screenshot, or site name. A pasted screenshot is worth
   a paragraph.
3. **Concrete parameters** -- numbers and measurable adjectives: speed, density,
   mouse influence radius, palette, amplitude.
4. **Constraints** -- "must run smooth on mobile", "respect reduced-motion",
   "must not hurt the readability of text on top".
5. **Placement** -- "hero background, behind the headline" or "on hover of the
   project cards".

### Vocabulary for tuning (no API knowledge required)

Name the sensation precisely; translate it to code:

- **Rhythm:** slower / faster / with a pause / breathing
- **Density:** denser / sparser / finer / heavier
- **Mouse reaction:** larger influence radius / subtler / with lag (inertia) /
  pushes vs. attracts
- **Movement:** more organic / more mechanical / with noise / in a wave
- **Color:** more contrast / pull toward the background tone / glow only at center
- **Visual weight:** more discreet / more of a protagonist / must not compete
  with the text

For shader-tier effects (distortion, generative textures, SDF), there is a
matching concept toolkit and tuning vocabulary in
[references/shaders.md](references/shaders.md).

For the ready-to-adapt recipes (smooth scroll, scroll reveals, evolving a point
field, hover image distortion, floating 3D object) with starter prompts and the
order to tackle them, see [references/recipes.md](references/recipes.md).

---

## Step 2: Guardrails (apply or ask for every effect)

Bake these in from the start to avoid rework:

- **Client + `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })`** for any WebGL/canvas
  component -- they only exist in the browser.
- **Pause the loop offscreen** (IntersectionObserver) -- do not burn battery.
- **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`** -- always offer the still version.
- **Cap `dpr` at 2 and drop density on mobile** -- the top cause of phone jank.
- **Comment every tunable parameter at the top** so the designer can adjust alone.
- **Hover is not touch.** If a hover *reveals essential content or a CTA*, give
  mobile an explicit **tap** path (open on tap, close on tap) with a **visible
  affordance** signalling it is interactive. Test on a real touch target -- a
  resized desktop window still has hover and hides the bug. If hover is only a
  flourish (glow, slight scale), it is fine to lose it on mobile.

---

## Step 3: The craft filter (your designer edge)

This is where a designer beats a dev who knows the API but not what looks good.
Before calling an effect done, check:

- **Easing and timing.** Ease-out for entering, ease-in for leaving, ease-in-out
  for repositioning. Never linear except progress bars and shimmer.
- **The 12 animation principles** (anticipation, follow-through, staging,
  slow-in/slow-out...). This is what separates alive from robotic.
- **Choreography.** Stagger, hierarchy of movement, what enters first and what
  follows. Composition in time.
- **When NOT to animate.** Restraint is craft. Movement that does not serve the
  content is noise.
- **The effect must not steal from the content.** The headline wins, always.

For the animation principles, easing as craft, and the reusable fundamentals
(lerp/damping, noise, the minimal math, the 16ms budget, motion ethics), see
[references/motion-craft.md](references/motion-craft.md).

## Step 4: Ship gate (performance, accessibility, SEO)

Before integrating into a real page, confirm:

- [ ] Holds 60fps (16ms/frame) on a mid mobile, not just your machine.
- [ ] Heavy libs (Three.js) lazy-loaded so the weight lands only on the page that
      uses the effect.
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` path exists and is not broken.
- [ ] Real title, copy, and links live in the HTML -- canvas/3D text is invisible
      to Google and screen readers. WebGL is decoration on top.
- [ ] Mobile has a tap path for any hover that hides essential content.

---

## Pitfalls (hard-won)

- **Server error in Next ("window is not defined").** WebGL/canvas need
  `"use client"` and usually `dynamic(..., { ssr: false })`.
- **Phone stutter.** Almost always density too high or `devicePixelRatio`
  unbounded. Cap dpr, cut particle count on mobile, pause offscreen.
- **Bloated bundle.** Three.js is hundreds of KB. Lazy-load it per page.
- **Forgotten accessibility.** Constant motion nauseates. `prefers-reduced-motion`
  is not optional in a serious site.
- **Effect competing with content.** If you strain to read the text, dial it back.
- **Content trapped in the canvas.** SEO and screen readers cannot see painted or
  3D text -- keep the real content in the DOM.
- **Hover that dies on touch.** See Step 2. The classic: a hover-revealed CTA that
  is invisible and unreachable on a phone.

---

## Working with other skills

- **ui-designer** owns static visual craft and *micro-motion*: easing curves,
  hover/press/focus states, a simple fade or 50-80ms stagger on ordinary UI. When
  the motion is that small, hand back to ui-designer. This skill takes over for
  scroll-driven, canvas, WebGL, generative, or otherwise "creative-coding" motion.
- **ux-designer** owns flows, psychology, and usability. Motion in service of a
  flow decision is theirs; the effect craft is yours.
- **design-system** owns tokens and component infrastructure.
- **frontend-design** owns bold overall aesthetic direction (landing/portfolio
  look). It sets the vibe; this skill builds the movement inside it.

When another skill fits better, say so directly.

---

## NEVER

- **NEVER** ship a WebGL/canvas component without `"use client"` + `ssr: false`.
- **NEVER** leave an animation loop running while offscreen.
- **NEVER** skip `prefers-reduced-motion` -- always provide the still version.
- **NEVER** leave `dpr` unbounded or run full desktop density on mobile.
- **NEVER** hide essential content or a CTA behind hover with no touch path.
- **NEVER** put real content or links only in canvas/3D (SEO + a11y).
- **NEVER** climb to WebGL when CSS or Canvas 2D delivers the scene.
- **NEVER** integrate an effect into an approved page before it is seen running.
- **NEVER** use linear easing except progress bars and shimmer loops.
- **NEVER** animate layout properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`) -- only
  `transform` and `opacity`.
